# NETFLIX-MOVIE-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTRING
Based on factors such as ratings, genres, and year of release, this project groups Netflix films and TV episodes. Users may use it to locate related material, while content creators can use it to get ideas. Data preparation, feature engineering, model choice, and assessment are all done with Python code.

# Overview
Netflix offers its subscribers access to a huge collection of films and TV series through a subscription-based streaming service. It might be difficult for consumers to locate material that matches their tastes in such a big content catalogue. Netflix employs machine learning and data analysis methods like clustering to classify its content into related categories in order to solve this problem. In order to enhance user experience and offer specialised suggestions, this repository concentrates on the data-driven strategy of grouping Netflix's films and TV episodes.

# Objective
Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering's main goal is to improve the Netflix user experience by offering tailored content suggestions based on customers' tastes and viewing habits. By grouping the content library's titles into clusters, Netflix hopes to provide recommendations for films and TV shows that are more likely to fit users' tastes. This should raise user engagement and happiness, which would, in turn, improve user retention and financial results for the firm.

# Clustering Process
In order to find patterns and similarities between numerous titles, the clustering method entails analysing a variety of data points, including genre, cast, director, narrative, and other pertinent elements. Netflix uses unsupervised machine learning techniques including principle component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and k-means to divide films and TV series into various groupings or genres.

The algorithms work as follows:

 **K-means:** Data are divided into k clusters using the K-means method, where k is a fixed number. It repeatedly allocates data points to the closest centroid and modifies the centroid locations in accordance with the points it has received. K-means is useful for classifying films and TV shows into discrete groups that reflect various genres or categories.

**Hierarchical clusteringUsing:** a method called "hierarchical clustering," which resembles a tree, films and TV series are sorted into groups according to common traits. Each title is initially clustered separately, then groups are progressively combined depending on how similar they are to create a hierarchical structure.

# Benefits
With the help of the potent clustering technology, Netflix can analyse and classify its enormous collection of material into related categories, giving consumers tailored suggestions and enhancing the overall user experience. Among the principal advantages of clustering are:

**Personalized Recommendations:** Netflix may suggest material that is relevant to viewers' interests by using clustering algorithms, as well as an analysis of users' watching patterns and preferences. The possibility that consumers would renew their subscriptions improves thanks to this personalised strategy.

**Data-Driven Decision Making:** Clustering helps Netflix to make data-driven choices on the creation and licencing of content. The platform may optimise its content collection, create or buy titles that resonate with its user base, and get rid of those that are less popular by comprehending underlying trends and patterns in user behaviour.

# Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files and directories:

data: The dataset used to group Netflix films and TV series is kept in this directory. It has crucial elements including genre, actors, director, and narrative.

notebooks: The Jupyter notebooks in this directory walk through the clustering and analysis processes step-by-step. It offers comprehensive analyses of the employed algorithms and how they were implemented.

results: The grouped clusters and their related titles are stored in this directory, which also contains the clustering results. Any visualisations or conclusions drawn from the clustering analysis are also included.

This file's README.md gives a general description of the repository, outlining its goals, the clustering procedure, advantages, and repository structure.
